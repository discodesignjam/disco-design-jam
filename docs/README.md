### What is the D.I.S.C.O.?
The DISCO is an acronym referencing the purpose of the design jam our toolkit aims to help people experience. DISCO stands for:
Design
Inclusive 
Spaceships
Collaborative
Operation

Not only does it get at the goal of the design jam, it also gets at the vibe. These workshops are meant to be an exciting, creative, and (responsibly) playful introduction to accessible and inclusive design– to counter the narratives that accessibility makes designs inherently “boring” or that accessibility is daunting to start learning. 
DISCO designers get to play with all kinds of fun multimedia. We invite you to ask “what if?” rather than say “but it’s always been this way!” 
At the DISCO, we imagine futures that invite everyone to join the party.
So an acronym referencing a dance party felt like just the right touch of whimsy for naming this operation.
