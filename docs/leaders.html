          This document, marked “FOR ALL SHIPS” and living within the Ship Blueprint folder, contains a <strong>list of elements/spaces that are required in every ship,</strong> regardless of its purpose. 
          You will be asked to select a few ship-specific spaces from your Ship Type card to design, as well as a few general spaces from this list. (The exact number depends on your workshop group size: your DISCO leader will tell you)

          <h2>Access Need Pamphlets</h2>
          <p>
            There are 
            <strong>four access needs pamphlets in the toolkit </strong>
            (sensory, communication, body/mobility, brain/mind), 
            <strong>to help workshop leaders who are new to the topic learn about accessibility.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Each category has some basic information around relevant conditions, then some 
            <strong>DISCO-Do’s </strong>
            (accessibility practices that will help make an environment more inclusive to folks with a given condition) and 
            <strong>DISCO-Don'ts </strong>
            (common barriers that exist on Earth that we don’t repeat in our spaceships). 
            Each section ends with a couple social media accounts, projects, or books that center perspectives of disability community members that share one or more of the conditions in that section. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Where information is relevant to a crew member in the crew persona deck, there may be a 
            <strong>persona highlight </strong>
            added with information about a species, particularly relevant adaptive designs that would fit their bodies, etc. 
            Leaders can choose to share these highlights with participants when they need a hint or suggestion to get them rolling in the right direction.
